# Meta Store Referral Links
This is a list of referral links for the meta store granting you a 25% discount when purchasing games and apps. Each link is only valid for a specific game or app.

There are two restrictions on that though:
* The game or app must have a price of at least 10€.
* Already discounted games or apps won't get an additional discount.

All you have to do is clicking on the link which will open a recommendation in either the app or the browser which you will have to claim. If you then end up buying the game or app within 7 days, I will get 5€ store credit.

## Device Referral
In case you do not own a Meta Quest device yet and happen to live in Germany, here is a device referral link which you need to claim before signing in on your new Meta Quest device for the first time: https://www.meta.com/referrals/link/Naitakal

Claiming this will give us both 30€ store credit.
